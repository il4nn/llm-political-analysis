## LLM Political Analysis

This project aims to analyse the responses of different LLMs to the PolitiScales Test (online political test).
By making the LLMs complete the test, we can examine their political tendencies, biases, and inclinaisons.   Specifically, we compare models from different geopolitical backgrounds (USA vs CHINA) to assess whether the ideologies of their respective countries influence their responses.

### Models Compared
- **Qwen-QWQ-32B** – Developed by a Chinese company (Alibaba Cloud).
- **Llama-3.3-70B-SpecDec** – Developed by an American company (Meta AI).
